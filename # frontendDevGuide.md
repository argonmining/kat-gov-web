# Kat Gov Frontend Development Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide for building the frontend of the **Kat Gov** Governance Web Application. The frontend will be modern, visually appealing, and highly functional, designed to provide a seamless user experience across all devices. It will also include performance optimizations like lazy loading, responsive design, and interactive features for managing proposals and elections.

## Key Objectives

1. **Modern, Aesthetic Design**: Clean, professional, and engaging visual style.
2. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive navigation and interaction elements for easy use.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement lazy loading, optimized images, and efficient data handling.
4. **Responsive Design**: Ensure compatibility across all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).

## Project Structure Overview

The frontend will be built with **React** and **TypeScript** using the **Next.js** framework for server-side rendering (SSR) and SEO optimization. **Tailwind CSS** will be used for styling, providing a flexible and responsive design system.

## Page and Component Breakdown

### Homepage (`pages/index.tsx`)

The homepage serves as an overview of the governance platform, providing key statistics and links to the main sections.

- **Statistics Display**: Shows basic metrics such as the number of proposals, votes, and active elections. Uses the `StatsDisplay.tsx` component.
- **Highlighted Voting Item**: Displays an active or highlighted vote, allowing users to engage immediately.
- **Navigation Links**: Clear links to the Proposals and Elections pages.

**Components Used**:
- `StatsDisplay.tsx`: Displays governance metrics.
- `Navbar.tsx`: Provides navigation to main sections of the site.
  
---

### Proposals Page (`pages/proposals/index.tsx`)

Displays a list of all proposals, organized in a tabbed layout according to their status (e.g., "Pending," "Approved," "Rejected," etc.). Within each tab, proposals are displayed as interactive cards, not just text tables, for an engaging presentation.

- **Tabs**: Each tab represents a proposal status, retrieving data from the backend based on the current tab.
- **Proposal Card**: Each proposal is shown as a card, displaying key information like title, status, and voting end date.
- **Filter and Sort**: Users can filter and sort proposals within each tab for easier navigation.
- **Submit Proposal Button**: Link to the "Submit Proposal" page.

**Components Used**:
- `Tabs.tsx`: Handles tabbed navigation for filtering proposals by status.
- `ProposalCard.tsx`: Displays individual proposal details as an interactive card.
- `FilterSort.tsx`: Allows users to filter and sort proposals.

---

### Supporting Proposal Pages

1. **Proposal Detail (`pages/proposals/[id].tsx`)**: Displays detailed information about a specific proposal, including description, status, and current vote counts.
2. **Submit Proposal (`pages/proposals/submit.tsx`)**: A form for users to submit a new proposal, including fields for title, description, category, and attachments.
3. **Edit Proposal (`pages/proposals/edit/[id].tsx`)**: Allows users to edit existing proposals that they have submitted.
4. **Nominate Proposal (`pages/proposals/nominate/[id].tsx`)**: Interface for nominating a proposal, showing current nomination counts.
5. **Proposal Vote (`pages/proposals/vote/[id].tsx`)**: Voting interface where users can cast YES or NO votes.

Each of these pages should be designed to ensure ease of use, with clear prompts, error messages, and loading indicators where appropriate.

---

### Elections Page (`pages/elections/index.tsx`)

The Elections page displays all elections, using a tabbed layout to organize them by timeframes: Past, Current, and Future.

- **Tabs**: Only three tabs (Past, Current, Future) are needed for elections, with data loaded dynamically for each.
- **Election Card**: Similar to proposal cards, each election is displayed as an interactive card showing essential details (e.g., position, candidates, status).
- **Filter and Sort**: Users can filter and sort elections within each tab.

**Components Used**:
- `Tabs.tsx`: Handles tabbed navigation for Past, Current, and Future elections.
- `ElectionCard.tsx`: Displays individual election details as a card.
- `FilterSort.tsx`: Allows users to filter and sort elections.

---

### Supporting Election Pages

1. **Election Detail (`pages/elections/[id].tsx`)**: Detailed information on an election, including candidates, current vote counts, and position details.
2. **Submit Candidate (`pages/elections/submit.tsx`)**: A form where users can submit their candidacy for an upcoming election.
3. **Nominate Candidate (`pages/elections/nominate/[id].tsx`)**: Page to nominate a candidate for an election.
4. **Candidate Review (`pages/elections/review/[id].tsx`)**: Allows users to review candidates for an election, with a focus on transparency.
5. **Election Vote (`pages/elections/vote/[id].tsx`)**: Voting interface for elections, showing candidates and allowing users to cast their votes.

Each of these pages should include tooltips or descriptions to guide users through the election process.

---

## Components

1. **`Navbar.tsx`**: The main navigation bar, displayed on all pages. Provides quick access to Proposals, Elections, and Home, with dropdowns for additional options.
2. **`Tabs.tsx`**: A tab component that switches between content sections based on current selection. Used on both the Proposals and Elections pages.
3. **`ProposalCard.tsx` and `ElectionCard.tsx`**: Card components for displaying proposals and elections, respectively. These cards should be visually appealing, with quick-access buttons for actions like voting or viewing details.
4. **`FilterSort.tsx`**: Component for filtering and sorting lists of proposals and elections, with options based on the backend data fields.
5. **`StatsDisplay.tsx`**: A component to show governance platform statistics like total proposals and elections, updated in real-time.

## Styling and Performance Optimizations

- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Consistent styling with Tailwind classes, including responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile layouts.
- **Lazy Loading**: Use React’s `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to load components as needed, especially on pages with multiple tabs or heavy data lists.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure all pages and components adapt to various screen sizes by using responsive Tailwind classes and media queries as needed.
- **Image Optimization**: Use Next.js's `Image` component to handle image loading, ensuring fast loading times and proper scaling on all devices.
- **SEO**: Use Next.js’s built-in SEO capabilities, including setting dynamic meta tags based on page content (e.g., proposal titles, election names).

---

## Utility Functions

- **API Wrappers (`api.ts`)**: Functions to fetch data from the backend, structured to handle errors gracefully. Each API function should follow a consistent format for error handling and logging.
- **Formatters (`formatters.ts`)**: Helper functions for formatting dates, numbers, and other data elements for consistent display across the application.

---

## Future Enhancements

The following features are planned but can be implemented as additional components and pages:
- **Notifications**: Alert users when a new proposal or election is live.
- **Dark Mode**: Allow users to switch between light and dark themes.
- **User Profiles**: Enable user accounts for tracking voting history, proposal submissions, etc.
